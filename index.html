<h1>Our Global Campus</h1>
<p>Kings College Budo is located about 12km west of Kampala, in Nsangi sub-county wakiso district. It was founded in 1906 by the Church Missionary Society(CMS). It was founded on land donated by the Kabaka (King) of Buganda.
    The original vision was to train sons of Kings and Chiefs, therefore it began as a boys school. In 1934, girls were admitted as well, thus became co-educational. It is now a government aided A- Level mixed Boarding school under Church of Uganda ( Anglican ) of Namirembe Diocese. The current population is 1619 with ⅓ (one third) being female.</p>

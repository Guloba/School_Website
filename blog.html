    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>King's College, Budo was founded in 1906 by the Church Missionary Society(CMS). It was founded on land donated by the Kabaka (King) of Buganda.<br>The original vision was to train sons of Kings and Chiefs, therefore it began as a boys school. In 1934, girls were admitted as well, thus became co-educational. It is now a government aided A- Level mixed Boarding school under Church of Uganda ( Anglican ) of Namirembe Diocese. The current population is 1619 with ⅓ (one third) being female.</p>
